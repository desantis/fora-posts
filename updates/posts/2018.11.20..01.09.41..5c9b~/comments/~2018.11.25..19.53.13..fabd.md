It's important to have a strategy that works for you, optimizing for your particular threat model and likely usage requirements for keys. The Urbit Wallet is a sane default that supports a variety of custody-access-use patterns, but we also took into consideration that some people will prefer to use a hardware wallet like Ledger or an 'institutional custody' solution like BitGo. Technically, there's no reason to use our tooling â€“ everything is compatible with existing tooling in the Ethereum ecosystem for dealing with addresses and executing smart contracts. Shoot a message to registration@urbit.org and we'd be happy to talk through your options if that would be helpful.
