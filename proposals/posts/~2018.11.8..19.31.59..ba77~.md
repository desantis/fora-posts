# UP 8: Urbit HD Wallet

## Overview

The Urbit Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet is a type-1 HD wallet of [BIP32 type-2 HD wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) that uses public-key cryptography to secure the ownership and control of Urbit address space.

The Urbit HD Wallet is not one key-pair, but a system of related key-pairs that each have distinct powers, from setting networking keys for communicating in the Urbit network to transferring ownership of your Urbit ship. 

We use the Ethereum blockchain for the Urbit public-key infrastructure (PKI). If you are interested in reading about the motivation behind the decision to use Ethereum, see our [post](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org/blob/master/main/blog/2017.9-eth.md) from 2017.9.


## Rationale

Urbit address space is non-fungible and finite. Thus, in addition to its functional value, address space has financial value. Owners of address space need safeguards that allow for interacting on the Urbit network without jeopardizing cryptographic ownership of their assets. 

Toward this end, Ethereum addresses that own a particular ship can designate additional addresses as proxies for specific sets of functions. These functions include resetting networking keys, spawning child ships, voting on Urbit proposals, and so forth. You can find the full set of on-chain functions in our [Constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution).

The Urbit HD Wallet's derivation paths also have this hierarchical structure, so that keys with different powers can be physically separated. A "master ticket" can re-derive the entire wallet in case of loss. The encryption and authentication keys that Urbit ships use to sign messages within the network are also derived from the wallet.

The full specification is detailed in the next section.

### Parameters

#### Ticket

64, 128 or 384 bits of entropy, encoded in `@q` notation.

`@q` notation encodes bytes as syllables, connecting two syllables as words, separating words by dashes.
`0x01` becomes `~nec`, `0x0201` `~binnec`, `0x030201` `~wes-binnec`, etc.
Not to be confused with `@p`, which also encodes in syllables, but scrambles them for values of 4 bytes and larger.

#### Ship

The numeric value of an Urbit identity/ship (max (2^32)-1), for deriving keys intended for use with that specific ship.

A value of `0` is used as the default, for the “no single/specific ship” case.

#### Revision

Integer to be incremented for generating new keys using the same ticket and ship, in case of key compromise.

Implementations may choose to support unique revision numbers per derived key type.

#### Passphrase

Optional string, used when turning generated BIP39 mnemonics into BIP32 seeds.

### Derivation of a wallet from a ticket

1. Generate a "master seed" from the ticket
  - Convert the ticket, a `@q` string, into a numeric value
  - Call Argon2 with the following parameters:
    - Out: 32 bytes
    - Type: u
    - Password: the ticket value
    - Salt: the string "urbitwallet"
    - Parallelization: 4
    - Memory cost: 512.000 KB
    - Time cost: 1
2. For each type, "ownership", "transfer", "spawn", "voting", "management", derive a mnemonic phrase (also referred to as "seed"):
  - Append a salt to the master seed. This salt is a string of the format: type-ship-revision
    - "type" is the string describing the type of key we're deriving,
    - "ship" is the ship parameter as a string (ie "0", or "1234"),
    - "revision" is the revision parameter as a string.
  - Hash the salted master seed using SHA2-256
  - Convert the resulting 256-bit output into a 24-word mnemonic sentence as specified in BIP39. We recommend using the [standard English wordlist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).
3. For each seed, to derive public/private keys and addresses:
  - Convert the seed (mnemonic phrase) plus the optional passphrase into a BIP32 seed, as specified in BIP39
  - Generate a BIP32 master node from the BIP32 seed (as per BIP32)
  - Derive the wallet at the path m/44'/60'/0'/0/0.
  - To derive an Ethereum address from the private key, use secp256k1 to get the uncompressed public key from the private key, then hash its last 64 bytes with keccak-256 and take the last 20 bytes from the result.
4. For the type "network", derive a seed as follows:
  - Convert the "management" seed (mnemonic phrase) plus the optional passphrase into a BIP32 seed, as specified in BIP39
  - Append a salt, of the format described under step 2, to the BIP32 seed
  - Hash the salted "management" seed using SHA2-256
5. Optionally, for the type "network", derive encryption and authentication keys as follows (identical to `++pit:nu:crub:crypto` in Urbit's standard library, [zuse](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/sys/zuse.hoon)):
  - Hash the "network" seed using SHA2-512
  - Take the first 256 bits of the result as the encryption private key
  - Take last 256 bits of the result as the authentication private key
  - Derive public keys for those using ed25519

### Integration Plan

Tlon has developed the [keygen-js library](https://github.com/urbit/keygen-js), which implements the above specification. This functionality will also exist in Arvo as a [library](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/877).

Tlon is currently developing a [Wallet Generator](https://github.com/urbit/wallet-generator), a browser-based application for the purpose of easily generating Urbit HD Wallets while offline. Wallet Generator uses the [keygen-js library](https://github.com/urbit/keygen-js).
