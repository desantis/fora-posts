If you are talking about ones from crowdsale / grants I would assume something like the following (I haven't actually done the process myself):

0. Complete the registration process as described in the email.
1. Someone from Urbit will reach out to schedule a video call.
2. During a call use geth or MEW or something like that to create a signed message for an Ethereum address.
3. Copy the signed message, send it to them via email (?)
4. They verify to see if the signed message was generated using the private key associated with the address.
