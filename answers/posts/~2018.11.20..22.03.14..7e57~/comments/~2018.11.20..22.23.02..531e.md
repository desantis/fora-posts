Yes, that's a totally valid thing to do!

The Urbit asset management tool we're working on will allow you to log in with/sign transactions with a hardware wallet. If you already have a hardware wallet you have in use, you can go through the advanced registration flow and specify its public address there, either as the ownership address, or one of the proxy addresses.

If you don't yet use your hardware wallet, or haven't even bought one yet, you can go through the wallet generator flow, and then initialize/reset your hardware wallet with one of the mnemonic seeds from one of the wallets that wallet generator gave you. Note that in this case, it's not possible to have multiple ships/proxies on the same hardware wallet.

Hope that clarifies! If not, keep asking away. (:
